Starting with adjusting the levels of the factors such that the baseline factor comes first.
`data$factor<- relevel(data$factor, "baseline")`

Next, calculate the model's chi squared statistic (which is analogous to the F statistic calculated with linear regression). This statistic looks to see if the difference between the null model (which is based on frequency alone) and the new model is significant. This is accomplished by subtracting the residual deviance (-2 log likleyhood or -2LL) from the null deviance. Use the script logistic regression chi squared
